There are a bunch of things in "modern" JS that irrationally scare me. I'm going to make a list of them so I can tackle them one by one. Earlier this morning I mentioned I wanted to learn ES6 techinques one-by-one, so here's a good hitlist of things I should attack.

## JS Syntax Stuff
* `.map()` I don't know why this scares me. I also don't know what it does.
* Arrow functions. There's not a lot here, but it scares me.
* The `require` syntax for modules. Or is it `import`? I don't know
* JSX. Okay that's probably going to be a big scary one.
* The `new` keyword
* The canvas element
* `.reduce()` I think
* `.filter()` a little bit

## Conceptual Things
* Functional programming
* Rotating an array (WHY??)
* Writing fizz buzz
* Other popular job interview whiteboard things, probably involving recursion

## Technologies
* React
* Redux
* Vue
* threeJS (or whatever it's called... it's a render library)
* Browserify
* Webpack
