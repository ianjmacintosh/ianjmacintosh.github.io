## This is a Challenge

I should set aside time daily to write about my travel experience. I think the most important thing will be simply committing the time and doing the work of writing. I'd like to minimize any potential obstacles to that.

Most obviously, I'd like to remove any associated logistical challenges, so here's a list of things I'd like to have sorted:

* Blogging platform chosen
* Ability to email updates to said platform
* GUI for updates
* Git access for updates? To allow tooling freedom
